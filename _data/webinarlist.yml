- title: "Combining data assimilation and machine learning to infer unresolved scale parametrisation"

  description: In recent years, machine learning (ML) has been proposed to devise data-driven parametrisations of unresolved processes in dynamical numerical models. In most cases, the ML training leverages high-resolution simulations to provide a dense, noiseless target state. Our goal is to go beyond the use of high-resolution simulations and train ML-based parametrisation using direct data, in the realistic scenario of noisy and sparse observations. The algorithm proposed in this work is a two-step process. First, data assimilation (DA) techniques are applied to estimate the full state of the system from a truncated model. The unresolved part of the truncated model is viewed as a model error in the DA system. In a second step, ML is used to emulate the unresolved part, a predictor of model error given the state of the system. Finally, the ML-based parametrisation model is added to the Å“physical core truncated model to produce a hybrid model.

  description: While most of the Geostatistical standard procedures suffer some severe limitations in presence of large data sets and large number of target sites (referred to as the big n problem), The Stochastic Partial Derivative Equations (SPDE) model is an efficient formalism which allows performing Estimation and Simulations.
