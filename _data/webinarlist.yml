  description: "Many key problems in climate dynamics require a huge computational effort. For instance, the study of extreme or rare events, the study of precursors of abrupt transitions to different climates, or the probabilistic prediction at the predictability margin, are three examples for which the computation of the relevant statistical quantities is impossible with reasonable computation resources, in comprehensive climate models. I will present several examples of new approaches we have developed, for instance using rare event algorithms and machine learning, for which we have solved these computational bottlenecks using concepts from statistical mechanics and dynamical systems\nThe first application is the study of extreme heat waves using IPCC class climate models. For these models we have demonstrated a gain of several hundreds in the numerical cost for simulating extremely rare heat waves. We were able to compute return time plots for extreme heat waves with return times up to 10 000 years. Using the hundreds of simulated heat waves, we have exhibited global teleconnection pattern for extreme heat waves\nThe second application is the computation of abrupt climate changes for Jupiter troposphere, and transitions to superrotating states for the Earth atmosphere dynamics.\nThe third application is a preliminary work on a simple model of El Nino to illustrate prediction at the predictability margin (prediction of interannual variability, beyond the Lyapunov time scale)."

- title: "Combining data assimilation and machine learning to infer unresolved scale parametrisation"
  image: Brajard.jpg
  description: In recent years, machine learning (ML) has been proposed to devise data-driven parametrisations of unresolved processes in dynamical numerical models. In most cases, the ML training leverages high-resolution simulations to provide a dense, noiseless target state. Our goal is to go beyond the use of high-resolution simulations and train ML-based parametrisation using direct data, in the realistic scenario of noisy and sparse observations. The algorithm proposed in this work is a two-step process. First, data assimilation (DA) techniques are applied to estimate the full state of the system from a truncated model. The unresolved part of the truncated model is viewed as a model error in the DA system. In a second step, ML is used to emulate the unresolved part, a predictor of model error given the state of the system. Finally, the ML-based parametrisation model is added to the Å“physical core truncated model to produce a hybrid model.

  description: While most of the Geostatistical standard procedures suffer some severe limitations in presence of large data sets and large number of target sites (referred to as the big n problem), The Stochastic Partial Derivative Equations (SPDE) model is an efficient formalism which allows performing Estimation and Simulations.
