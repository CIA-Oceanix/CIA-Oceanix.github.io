- title: "Combining data assimilation and machine learning to infer unresolved scale parametrisation"
  image: Brajard.jpg
  description: In recent years, machine learning (ML) has been proposed to devise data-driven parametrisations of unresolved processes in dynamical numerical models. In most cases, the ML training leverages high-resolution simulations to provide a dense, noiseless target state. Our goal is to go beyond the use of high-resolution simulations and train ML-based parametrisation using direct data, in the realistic scenario of noisy and sparse observations. The algorithm proposed in this work is a two-step process. First, data assimilation (DA) techniques are applied to estimate the full state of the system from a truncated model. The unresolved part of the truncated model is viewed as a model error in the DA system. In a second step, ML is used to emulate the unresolved part, a predictor of model error given the state of the system. Finally, the ML-based parametrisation model is added to the œphysical core truncated model to produce a hybrid model.

- title: "RESSTE (November 18) & SFdS Risk day (November 20)"
  image: sfds_resste.jpg
  description: Because two seminars are already organized in the French statistics community, OceaniX webinars are taking a break in November to come back in December with Julien Brajard's talk on December 16. The two webinars above mentioned respectively take place in the framework of the RESSTE network (RESeau Statistiques pour données Spatio-TEmporelles) and the SFdS (Société Française de Statistiques). The two webinars will talk about Risk, Extreme and Climate, thus directly related to the first OceaniX Webinar. Inscription is free but mandatory regarding the SfDS meeting (https://www.sfds.asso.fr/fr/environnement_et_statistique/658-journee_risque/) while a zoom link is available for the RESSTE webinar (https://informatique-mia.inrae.fr/reseau-resste/extremes-climat), see below.

- title: "Coupling machine learning approaches and rare event algorithms to compute extreme events in climate dynamics."
  image: Bouchet.jpg
  description: "Many key problems in climate dynamics require a huge computational effort. For instance, the study of extreme or rare events, the study of precursors of abrupt transitions to different climates, or the probabilistic prediction at the predictability margin, are three examples for which the computation of the relevant statistical quantities is impossible with reasonable computation resources, in comprehensive climate models. I will present several examples of new approaches we have developed, for instance using rare event algorithms and machine learning, for which we have solved these computational bottlenecks using concepts from statistical mechanics and dynamical systems\nThe first application is the study of extreme heat waves using IPCC class climate models. For these models we have demonstrated a gain of several hundreds in the numerical cost for simulating extremely rare heat waves. We were able to compute return time plots for extreme heat waves with return times up to 10 000 years. Using the hundreds of simulated heat waves, we have exhibited global teleconnection pattern for extreme heat waves\nThe second application is the computation of abrupt climate changes for Jupiter troposphere, and transitions to superrotating states for the Earth atmosphere dynamics.\nThe third application is a preliminary work on a simple model of El Nino to illustrate prediction at the predictability margin (prediction of interannual variability, beyond the Lyapunov time scale)."
