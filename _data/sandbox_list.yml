  description: The presence of pattern of inter-connections between nodes (called network motifs) in real complex networks has been widely studied and documented. Our study aims to search for meaningful patterns in a MLP network before and after training. Simulations show that the final network topology is shaped by learning dynamics, but can be strongly biased by choosing appropriate weight initialization schemes. Overall, our results suggest that non-trivial initialization strategies can make learning more effective by promoting the development of useful network motifs, which are often surprisingly consistent with those observed in general transduction networks.

- title: "Carlo's talk on Multiscale Complexity"
  image: carlos_talk.png
  description: Nowadays, the multi-scale character of complex natural systems is confirmed as a fact. Turbulence, which is considered as the last frontier of classical physics, is used as a benchmark of this type of systems. Thus due to its tremendous importance, several frameworks have been historically developed to describe it. However, the existing approaches present limitations to cover the full description of multi-scale couplings. As a consequence of these drawbacks, new progresses in the field are needed. Thus, I propose to develop a statistical framework based on Information Theory to deal with multi-scale coupling descriptions of physical systems and processes.
