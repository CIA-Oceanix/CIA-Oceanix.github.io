- title: "Narrowing uncertainties of climate projections using data science tools?"
  image: pierre.jpg
  description: Next AI4Climate seminar (supported by SAMA and SCAI). Climate indices show large variability in CMIP climate predictions. In this presentation, we propose to weight multi-model climate simulations to reduce the uncertainty in climate predictions, and better estimate the future evolution of climate indices. The proposed methodology is based on advanced data science tools (i.e, data assimilation, analog forecasting, model evidence metrics), to accurately compute distances between current observations and simulated climate indices. This low-cost procedure is tested on a simplified climate model. The results show that the methods can be applied locally and is able to identify relevant parameterizations.

- title: "History Matching and Machine Learning for the tuning of climate models"
  image: redouane_sandbox.jpg
  description: A major cause of earth system model discrepancies result from processes that are missed or are incorrectly represented in the model’s equations. Despite the increasing number of collected observations, reducing parametric uncertainties is still an enourmous challenge. The process of relying on experience and intuition to find good sets of parameters, commonly referred to as parameter tuning keeps having a central role in the roadmaps followed by dozens of modeling groups involved in community efforts such as the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). In the talk I’ll present a tool from the Uncertainty Quantification community that started recently to draw attention in climate modeling, History Matching also referred to as « Iterative Refocussing ». The core idea of History Matching is to run several simulations with different set of parameters and then use observed data to rule-out any parameter settings which are “implausible”. Since climate simulation models are computationally heavy and do not allow testing every possible parameter setting, we employ an emulator that can be a cheap and accurate replacement. Here a machine learning algorithm, namely, Gaussian Process Regression is used for the emulating step. History Matching is then a good example where the recent advances in machine learning can be of high interest to climate modeling. I will show some results using History Matching on a toy model, the two-layer Lorenz96, and share some findings about the challenges and opportunities of using this technique.

- title: "Learning sparse structures for modal estimation in underwater acoustics"
  image: default.jpg
  description: In underwater acoustics, shallow water environments act as modal dispersive waveguides when considering low-frequency sources. In this context, propagating signals can be described as a sum of few modal components, each of them propagating according to its own wavenumber. Estimating these wavenumbers is of key interest to understand the propagating environment as well as the emitting source. To solve this problem, we proposed recently a Bayesian approach exploiting a sparsity-inforcing prior. When dealing with broadband sources, this model can be further improved by integrating the particular dependence linking the wavenumbers from one frequency to the other. In this contribution, we propose to resort to a restricted Boltzmann machine, exploited as a generic structured sparsity-inforcing model. This model can indeed be efficiently learned on physically realistic simulated data using well-known algorithms. Then, its integration in a variational Bayesian algorithm allows to solve the modal estimation in an elegant way.

- title: "Applying Conditional Generative Adversarial Models on Ocean Observations"
  image: default.jpg
  description: Deep learning models usually lie on the representation of the input domain in a so-called latent space that contains meaningful encoding of the input's semantic, from which it is easier to infer a categorization or a segmentation than from the original image space. Generative Adversarial Models, or GAN, on the other hand, aim to learn a latent space from which realistic synthetic data can be produced. As such, generative models can be considered to obtain a general representation that could be reused for a variety of tasks. It can also be used to generate new groundtruths for data augmentation, in which case conditional generation is required to select some aspect of the generated data. In the context of SAR imagery, constraints on the generator have to be integrated to take into account some particularities of the ocean observations, in particular the preponderance of high-frequency patterns.

  - title: "Learning disentangled representations in a weakly-supervised manner."
  image: eduardo_sandbox.jpg
  description: We investigate the problem of learning disentangled representations. Given a pair of images sharing some attributes, we aim to create a low-dimensional representation which is split into two parts, a shared representation that captures the common information between the images and an exclusive representation that contains the specific information of each image. To address this issue, we propose a model based on mutual information estimation without relying on image reconstruction or image generation. We show that disentangled representations are useful to perform downstream tasks such as image classification and image retrieval based on the shared or exclusive component. Moreover, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art models based on VAE/GAN approaches in representation disentanglement.

- title: "Deep learning and Trajectory Representation for the Prediction of Seabird Diving Behaviour"
  image: amedee.jpg
  description: Seabirds’ behavior provides invaluable information for the study of marine ecosystems, since their foraging strategies give us a real-time response to the complex dynamics of the ecosystem. In particular, by deploying sufficiently light GPS sensors on seabirds, it is possible to obtain their trajectories, to identify behaviors at sea and foraging areas. This work addresses the inference of seabird diving behaviour from GPS data using Deep Learning methods. From a database of about 250 foraging trajectories derived from GPS data deployed simultaneously with pressure sensors for the identification of dives. Within a supervised setting, we show that the representations of trajectory data (time-series vs distance matrix) greatly affect the ability of deep learning architectures to infer diving behaviour for two tropical seabird species. We also point out the potential impact on the estimation of dives distribution.

  image: matteo_sandbox.png
  description: The presence of pattern of inter-connections between nodes (called network motifs) in real complex networks has been widely studied and documented. Our study aims to search for meaningful patterns in a MLP network before and after training. Simulations show that the final network topology is shaped by learning dynamics, but can be strongly biased by choosing appropriate weight initialization schemes. Overall, our results suggest that non-trivial initialization strategies can make learning more effective by promoting the development of useful network motifs, which are often surprisingly consistent with those observed in general transduction networks.

- title: "Simon's talk on the variational learning of sea surface current reconstructions from AIS data streams."
  image: simon_sandbox.jpg
  description: Space oceanography missions, especially altimeter missions, have considerably improved the observation of sea surface dynamics over the last decades. They can however hardly resolve spatial scales below ∼ 100km. Meanwhile the AIS (Automatic Identification System) monitoring of the maritime traffic implicitly conveys information on the underlying sea surface currents as the trajectory of ships is affected by the current. Here, we show that an unsupervised variational learning scheme provides new means to elucidate how AIS data streams can be converted into sea surface currents. The proposed scheme relies on a learnable variational framework and relate to variational auto-encoder approach coupled with neural ODE (Ordinary Differential Equation) solving the targeted ill-posed inverse problem. Through numerical experiments on a real AIS dataset, we demonstrate how the proposed scheme could contribute to the reconstruction of sea surface currents from AIS data.

- title: "Carlo's talk on Multiscale Complexity"
  image: carlos_talk.png
  description: Nowadays, the multi-scale character of complex natural systems is confirmed as a fact. Turbulence, which is considered as the last frontier of classical physics, is used as a benchmark of this type of systems. Thus due to its tremendous importance, several frameworks have been historically developed to describe it. However, the existing approaches present limitations to cover the full description of multi-scale couplings. As a consequence of these drawbacks, new progresses in the field are needed. Thus, I propose to develop a statistical framework based on Information Theory to deal with multi-scale coupling descriptions of physical systems and processes.
