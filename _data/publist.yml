- title: "Online Calibration of Deep Learning Sub-Models for Hybrid Numerical Modeling Systems"
  image: fig_ega-2024.jpg
  description:  Online learning methodologies thus require the numerical model to be differentiable, which is not the case for most modeling systems. To overcome this difficulty and bypass the differentiability challenge of physical models, we present an efficient and practical online learning approach for hybrid systems. The method, called EGA for Euler Gradient Approximation, assumes an additive neural correction to the physical model, and an explicit Euler approximation of the gradients. We demonstrate that the EGA converges to the exact gradients in the limit of infinitely small time steps. Numerical experiments are performed on various case studies, including prototypical ocean-atmosphere dynamics.

- title: "Inversion of Sea Surface Currents From Satellite-Derived SST-SSH Synergies With 4DVarNets"
  image: fig_james_uv_ssh_sst-2024.jpg
  description:  Satellite altimetry provides a unique means for direct observation of sea surface currents, but it is confined to the geostrophic component, limiting the recovery of a substantial portion of mesoscale sea surface currents in operational products. To address this limitation, we present a novel deep learning framework, rooted in a variational data assimilation paradigm, that unlocks new avenues for leveraging the synergistic relationships between satellite-derived sea surface observations, namely sea surface height and sea surface temperature. This innovative scheme demonstrates its remarkable potential to enhance sea surface current reconstruction and recover a substantial portion of the elusive ageostrophic dynamics.

  image: fig_4dvarnet-UQ-lafon-2023.jpg
  description: This study proposes an end-to-end Neural Network (NN) scheme based on a Variational Bayes (VB) inference formulation. It combines an ELBO (Evidence Lower BOund) variational cost to a trainable gradient-based solver to infer the state posterior pdf given observation data. The inference of the posterior and the trainable solver are learnt jointly. We demonstrate the relevance of the proposed scheme for a Gaussian parameterization of the posterior and different case-study experiments.

  image: fig_frezat_james_2023.jpg
  description: In this paper, we focus on the representation of energy backscatter in two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic turbulence and compare parametrizations obtained with different learning strategies at fixed computational complexity. We show that strategies based on a priori criteria yield parametrizations that tend to be unstable in direct simulations and describe how subgrid parametrizations can alternatively be trained end-to-end in order to meet a posteriori criteria. We illustrate that end-to-end learning strategies yield parametrizations that outperform known empirical and data-driven schemes in terms of performance, stability, and ability to apply to different flow configurations.

- title: "Multimodal 4DVarNets for the reconstruction of sea surface dynamics from SST-SSH synergies"
  image: fig_SST-SSH4DVarNet.jpg
  description: Due to the irregular space-time sampling of sea surface observations, the reconstruction of sea surface dynamics is a challenging inverse problem. While satellite altimetry provides a direct observation of the sea surface height (SSH), which relates to the divergence-free component of sea surface currents, the associated sampling pattern prevents from retrieving fine-scale sea surface dynamics, typically below a 10-day time scale. By contrast, other satellite sensors provide higher-resolution observations of sea surface tracers such as sea surface temperature (SST). Multimodal inversion schemes then arise as an appealing strategy. We introduce multimodal 4DVarNets and demonstrate their relevance for a Gulf Stream OSSE case-study.

  description: Remote sensing of rainfall events is critical for both operational and scientific needs. Ground-based weather radars, such as NOAA's Next-Generation Radar (NEXRAD), provide reflectivity and precipitation measurements of rainfall events. However, the observation range of such radars is limited to a few hundred kilometers. Here we propose a deep learning approach to extract rainfall information from SAR imagery. We demonstrate that a convolutional neural network, such as U-Net, trained on a colocated and preprocessed Sentinel1-NEXRAD dataset clearly outperforms state-of-the-art filtering schemes.

  description: Modeling the subgrid-scale dynamics of reduced models is a long standing open problem that finds application in ocean, atmosphere and climate predictions where direct numerical simulation (DNS) is impossible. While neural networks (NNs) have already been applied to a range of three-dimensional flows with success, two dimensional flows are more challenging because of the backscatter of energy from small to large scales. We show that learning a model jointly with the dynamical solver and a meaningful a-posteriori-based loss function lead to stable and realistic simulations when applied to quasi-geostrophic turbulence.
