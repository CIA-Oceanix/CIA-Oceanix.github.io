- title: "Bounded nonlinear forecasts of partially observed geophysical systems with physics-constrained deep learning"
  image: figBoundedNbedDyn_Sketch.jpg
  description: The complexity of real-world geophysical systems is often compounded by the fact that the observed measurements depend on hidden variables. These latent variables include unresolved small scales and/or rapidly evolving processes, partially observed couplings, or forcings in coupled systems. This is the case in ocean-atmosphere dynamics, for which unknown interior dynamics can affect surface observations. The identification of computationally-relevant representations of such partiallyobserved and highly nonlinear systems is thus challenging and often limited to short-term forecast applications. Here, we investigate the physics-constrained learning of implicit dynamical embeddings, leveraging neural ordinary differential equation representations. A key objective is to constrain their boundedness, which promotes the generalization of the learned dynamics to arbitrary initial condition. The proposed architecture is implemented within a deep learning framework, and its relevance is demonstrated with respect to state-of-the-art schemes for different case-studies representative of geophysical dynamics.

- title: "A posteriori learning of quasi-geostrophic turbulence parametrization: an experiment on integration steps"
  image: figAPosterioriClosure.jpg
  description: Modeling the subgrid-scale dynamics of reduced models is a long standing open problem that finds application in ocean, atmosphere and climate predictions where direct numerical simulation (DNS) is impossible. While neural networks (NNs) have already been applied to a range of three-dimensional flows with success, two dimensional flows are more challenging because of the backscatter of energy from small to large scales. We show that learning a model jointly with the dynamical solver and a meaningful a-posteriori-based loss function lead to stable and realistic simulations when applied to quasi-geostrophic turbulence.
