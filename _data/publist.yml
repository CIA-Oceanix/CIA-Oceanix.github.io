- title: "Learning Runge-Kutta Integration Schemes for ODE Simulation and Identification"
  image: figADRK.jpg
  description:  In this paper, we propose a novel framework to learn integration schemes that minimize an integration-related cost function. We demonstrate the relevance of the proposed learning-based approach for non-linear equations and include a quantitative analysis w.r.t. classical state-of-the-art integration techniques, especially where the latter may not apply.

- title: "Unsupervised Reconstruction of Sea Surface Currents from AIS Maritime Traffic Data Using Trainable Variational Models"
  image: figAISCurrent.jpg
  description: In this work we investigate the relevance of AIS data streams for the estimation of the surface current velocities. Using a physics-informed observation model, we propose to a trainable variational formulation.  Numerical experiments on a real AIS dataset off South Africa support the relevance of the proposed learning-based AIS-driven approach to significantly improve the reconstruction of sea surface currents compared with state-of-the-art methods, including altimetry-based ones.

- title: "Deep Learning and Trajectory Representation for the Prediction of Seabird Diving Behaviour"
  image: figSeabirdDive.jpg
  description:  We propose a novel deep learning model for seabird trajectory data. It combines the computational efficiency of CNNs to distance-matrix-based representations of trajectory data. Our model considerably increases the ability of deep networks to infer seabird behaviours, as well as their stability to different data inputs.
