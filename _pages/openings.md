# Open positions

We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!

You will have the chance to work on grand challenges at the interface between AI, Applied Math and Ocean Science. You will be involved in determining the important and interesting questions, creating and improving new algorithms combining physics and data-driven strategies, designing and running data challenges and benchmarking experiments, and making discoveries.

### Applications for PhD and Postdoc positions
If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student or postdoc, please send an [email](mailto:ronan.fablet@imt-atlantique.fr) to Pr. Ronan Fablet. State briefly why you are interested and attach a CV, including information about the grades you had as an undergraduate. No need for a separate cover letter or certificates. **Important**: please insert _"Application PhD"_ or _"Application Postdoc"_ in the subject line. If you are applying to a specific advertisement, note this in your email.

There are postdoc scholarship available.  We'd be happy to support you after you apply to our group. Take a look at the [Marie Curie fellowship](http://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/about-msca/actions/if/index_en.htm).

### MSc./Eng. internships
If you are a Master/engineering student looking for an internship, contact me (or any group member) per email or stop by my office.
