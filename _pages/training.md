OceaniX members organize different courses and training sessions on deep learning, data science, ocean remote sensing. We provide below more information on the following courses:
- Doctoral course on Data Science for Geosience [link](#doctoral-course-on-data-science-for-geoscience)
- Doctoral course on Deep Leearning and Geophysical Dynamics [link](#advanced-course-on-deep-learning-and-geophysical-dynamics)

## Doctoral course on Data Science for Geoscience
This doctoral course co-organized between Grenoble, Toulouse and Brest is an introductory course to data science for geoscientists. It covers generic theoretical concepts in data science and machine learning as well as various approaches and problems. Besides labsession using python, it also involves a group project to apply these concepts to a specific issue from the formulation of the problem to the interpretation of numerical experiments.

More information can be found from the website of last session held in Januatry 2020 [link](https://dsg2020.wordpress.com/). 
We plan to organize next session in Brest in January 2022. Do not hesitate to contact us for any additional information.

## Advanced Course on Deep Learning and Geophysical Dynamics
Next october we will organize the first edition of an advanced course on Deep Learning and Geophysical Dynamics co-organized by AI chairs OceaniX and AI4Child (Prof. R. Fablet and F. Rousseau). The general objective of the course will be to cover theoretical aspects of deep learning and its application to geophysical dynamics, especially regarding the exploitation of physical priors. Besides these theoretical aspects, the course will also aim to apply state-of-the-art deep leearning approaches to specific case-studies using pytorch.

The course will take place on **tuesdays five consecutive weeks from November 9 to December 7**. All morning sessions (typically, 9.30am-12.30pm, Paris time) will be dedicated to a course covering theoretical aspects combined with some pytorch practice, while all afternoon sessions will be dedicated to an advanced practice through a specific team project.

The provisional program for the different morning session is the following:
- Course #1 (Nov. 9): **Introduction to Deep Learning and Automatic Differentiation** (Prof. F. Rousseau)
- Course #2 (Nov. 16): **Deep Learning and Optimization** (Prof. L. Drumetz)
- Course #3 (Nov. 23): **Generative models** (Prof. P. Gallinari) **NB: this course will be held from 2.30pm and the morning session will be dedicated to the project**
- Course #4 (Nov. 30): **Deep Learning and Dynamical Systems** (Dr. S. Ouala)
- Course #5 (Dec. 7): **Deep Learning and Inverse Problems** (Prof. R. Fablet)

The introductory project session on November 9 will also include a short introduction to pytorch and Pytorch Lightning which will be the reference deep learning framework of the course. Examples of projects of interest for geophysical dynamics (more to come):
- Space-time interpolation of sea surface dynamics
- Forecasting of El Niño index
- Learning numerical schemes for ODEs and PDEs
- Data-driven system identfication and forecasting

**Pre-requisite**: Participants shall have some basic knowledge in applied math. and/or machine learning and some practice in Python programming. Previous knowledge in deep learning and pytorch is not a pre-requisite. We will provide some links prior to the course to online tutorials for Pytorch, so that all participants could gain at a first basic practice before the course. 

**Organization**: The course will be organized in person in Brest at the "Pôle Numérique Brest Iroise". It will also be possible to attend to the courses remotely. We expect to accomodate up to 50 participants for the course. 

**Registration and visiting scholarships**: there is no regstration fee but the registration is mandatory. We can offer visiting scholarships to young scientists (e.g., MSc. and PhD students, postdoctoral scientists) who would like to register for the course and would be interested by a short stay in our group covering the period of the course. Please fill in the following to apply for the course and a scholarship if interested [link](https://forms.gle/nt3469TKLdw7Fog99). Given the limit in the number of participants, we may not accept all applications. 

**Registration deadline**: September 27, 2021
