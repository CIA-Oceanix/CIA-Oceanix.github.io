OceaniX members organize different courses and training sessions on deep learning, data science, ocean remote sensing. We provide below more information on the following courses:
- Doctoral course on Data Science for Geosience [link](#doctoral-course-on-data-science-for-geoscience)
- Doctoral course on Deep Leearning and Geophysical Dynamics [link](#advanced-course-on-deep-learning-and-geophysical-dynamics)

## Doctoral course on Data Science for Geoscience
This doctoral course co-organized between Grenoble, Toulouse and Brest is an introductory course to data science for geoscientists. It covers generic theoretical concepts in data science and machine learning as well as various approaches and problems. Besides labsession using python, it also involves a group project to apply these concepts to a specific issue from the formulation of the problem to the interpretation of numerical experiments.

More information can be found from the website of last session held in Januatry 2020 [link](https://dsg2020.wordpress.com/). 
We plan to organize next session in Brest in January 2022. Do not hesitate to contact us for any additional information.

## Advanced Course on Deep Learning and Geophysical Dynamics
We will organize this year the second edition of the advanced course on Deep Learning and Geophysical Dynamics. The general objective of the course will be to cover theoretical aspects of deep learning and its application to geophysical dynamics, especially regarding the exploitation of physical priors. 

The course will take place on **tuesdays four consecutive weeks from November 15 to December 6** with the following four different lectures:
- Lecture #1 (Nov. 15): **Deep Learning and Optimization** (Prof. L. Drumetz) (9.30am-12.30pm) [webpage](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lucas-Drumetz)/[zoom link](https://cnrs.zoom.us/j/93638732901?pwd=cG1QdlhJUjNTTW1nd1hka2krcVJMZz09)/[Recorded videp](https://youtu.be/AfAeGBLEF7Q)
- Lecture #2 (Nov. 22): **Deep differentiable emulators** (Dr. D. Greenberg) (9.30am-12.30pm) [webpage](https://www.hereon.de/institutes/coastal_systems_analysis_modeling/model_driven_machine_learning/team/098795/index.php.en)/[zoom link](https://cnrs.zoom.us/j/95507484012?pwd=TFB2NXcvSnVvODFDYVQ5ck00MzRKZz09)
- Lecture #4 (Nov. 29): **Learning and Optimal Transport** (Prof. N. courty) (9.30am-12.30pm) [webpage](https://people.irisa.fr/Nicolas.Courty/)/[zoom link](https://cnrs.zoom.us/j/93683997886?pwd=NFE0NjdSTkhUeFBJbC9rR0U2M0FQdz09)
- Course #5 (Dec. 6): **Deep Learning, Optimal Interpolation and Data Assimilation** (Prof. R. Fablet) (9.30am-12.30pm) [webpage](https://rfablet.github.io/)/[zoom link](https://cnrs.zoom.us/j/97461908412?pwd=d0ZGbWtvTlpSc2kzMTVtQ1JVcUg5QT09)


**Co-working sessions**: In addition to the lectures, co-working sessions will be organized in the afternoons to have the additional opportunity to meet and discuss with the lecturers and oceanix chair members as well as to share experience on deep learning packages (e.g., lightning, hydra,...). Interested attendees will have the opportunity to present ongoing research topics for discussion. 

**Pre-requisite**: Participants shall have some basic knowledge in applied math. and/or machine learning and some practice in Python programming. Previous knowledge in deep learning and pytorch is not a pre-requisite. We will provide some links prior to the course to online tutorials for Pytorch, so that all participants could gain at a first basic practice before the course. 

**Online resources to prepare the course**
For those who have no or very little knowledge on deep learning and pytorch, below some resources:
- Introductory course from Stanford Univ. on deep learning [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwQHqWyHRpU&list=PLoROMvodv4rOABXSygHTsbvUz4G_YQhOb)
- Reference book on deep learning [link](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/mlp.html)
- Introduction to pytorch framework [link](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html)
- 60-minute blitz for pytorch [link](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html)

**Organization**: The lectures will be given in-person in Brest at IMT Atlantique on Nov.15 and at the "Pôle Numérique Brest Iroise" for the other dates. It will also be possible to attend to the lectures and co-working sessions remotely (zoom conference).
- **Session on Nov.15**: IMT Atlantique, Brest campus, room B1-010
- **Session on Nov.22, 29 and Dec.6**: PNBI, Technopôle Brest Iroise, room "TD Iroise" (1st floor)


**Registration deadline**: November 8, 2022. There are no registration fees. For organizational aspects, we request the interested people to register through the following link: [registration form](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html)
