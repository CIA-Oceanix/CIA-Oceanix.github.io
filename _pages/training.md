OceaniX members organize different courses and training sessions on deep learning, data science, ocean remote sensing. We provide below more information on the following courses:
- Doctoral course on Data Science for Geosience [link](#training-doctoral-course-on-data-science-for-geoscience)
- Doctoral course on Deep Leearning and Geophysical Dynamics

## Doctoral course on Data Science for Geoscience
This doctoral course co-organized between Grenoble, Toulouse and Brest is an introductory course to data science for geoscientists. It covers generic theoretical concepts in data science and machine learning as well as various approaches and problems. Besides labsession using python, it also involves a group project to apply these concepts to a specific issue from the formulation of the problem to the interpretation of numerical experiments.

More information can be found from the website of last session held in Januatry 2020 [link](https://dsg2020.wordpress.com/). 
We plan to organize next session in Brest in January 2022. Do not hesitate to contact us for any additional information.

## Course on Deep Learning and Geophysical Dynamics
Next october we will organize the first edition of an advanced course on Deep Learning and Geophysical Dynamics co-organized by AI chairs OceaniX and AI4Child.
